## External backends

An external backend can be added to Glow without changing the Glow build infrastructure. An external backend must be provided as a single source directory, and then can be developed in a separate source management repository.

### External backend structure

An external backend must have the following structure:
```
`-- <Name>
    |-- CMakeLists.txt
    |-- Backends
    |   |-- CMakeLists.txt
    |   |-- <main backend sources>
    |-- ClassGen
    |   |-- CMakeLists.txt
    |   |-- <ClassGen sources>
    `-- Tests
        |-- CMakeLists.txt
        |-- <Tests sources>
```

To be integrated into Glow and compiled, the backend directory must be placed in the `externalbackends/` sub-directory of the Glow project.


### Backend structure details

#### Defined cmake variables

When an external backend is detected and activated, the following cmake variable is defined:

- `EXTERNAL_BACKEND_NAME` : name derived from the external backend directory name. This can be used by the backend to name libraries, for instance.


There is the possibility to disable an detected external backend by setting the following cmake define to `OFF`:

- `GLOW_WITH_<BACKEND DIR NAME>`


#### C++ define

When an external backend is activated, Glow adds a global C++ compiler define that can be used to enclose backend-specific code in the generic Glow source code, based on the activation of this external backend:

- `GLOW_WITH_<BACKEND DIR NAME>`


#### Backend Core : Mandatory

The core of the external backend is mandatory and located in `<Name>/Backends/`. It must contain a `CMakeLists.txt` file that will ensure the correct compilation of the backend and the good integration with Glow.

The external backend must respect the same interface as standard backends.
It can be summarized the following way:

- Backend main class that inherits from the Glow `Backend` class. For example, class `<Name>Backend` in library `${EXTERNAL_BACKEND_NAME}`.
- Backend factory registration in a backend specific factory library. For example, calling `REGISTER_GLOW_BACKEND_FACTORY(<Name>Factory, <Name>Backend, <Name>)` in library `${EXTERNAL_BACKEND_NAME}Factory`.


The external backend is declared to Glow by setting the CMake `linked_factories` variable in the `<Name>/Backends/CMakeLists.txt`. Example:`set(linked_factories ${linked_factories} <Name>Factory PARENT_SCOPE)`

For more details, please refer to the general Glow backend documentation.

#### Top level CMake configuration file

Global configuration of the backend can be specified in a top level `<Name>/CMakeLists.txt`.

This file is optional.

#### Backend specific nodes and instructions

An external backend can optionally declare specific Glow nodes and instructions.
In this case, the `<Name>/ClassGen/CMakeLists.txt` must be provided and backend-specific Nodes and Instructions declaration headers declared.

CMake example:
```
set(VERIF_FILENAME <Name>SpecificNodesVerification.h)
configure_file(${VERIF_FILENAME}
               ${GLOW_BINARY_DIR}/glow/${VERIF_FILENAME} COPYONLY)

set(VERIF_FILENAME <Name>SpecificInstrsVerification.h)
configure_file(${VERIF_FILENAME}
               ${GLOW_BINARY_DIR}/glow/${VERIF_FILENAME} COPYONLY)
```

These header files must be included in the generic Glow code, respectivelly in `tools/ClassGen/NodeGen.cpp` and `tools/ClassGen/InstrGen.cpp`, at the end of the `main` function like standard backends.It is advised to enclose the backend specific include into `#ifdef GLOW_WITH_<BACKEND DIR NAME>`.

Example for specific nodes:
```
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  // <generic glow code>

#include "Backends/CPU/CPUSpecificNodes.h"
#include "Backends/OpenCL/OpenCLSpecificNodes.h"

#ifdef GLOW_WITH_<NAME>
# include "<Name>/ClassGen/<Name>SpecificNodes.h"
#endif

  return 0;
}

```


#### Backend-specific tests

Backend-specific tests can be added. In this case, the `<Name>/Tests/CMakeLists.txt` must be provided. The backend tests must be compiled as a library and registered to Glow with the `add_glow_test` cmake function.

CMake example:
```
add_executable(<Name>Test
		 <test sources>)

target_link_libraries(<Name>Test
                      PRIVATE
                        Backends
                        ExecutionEngine
                        Graph
                        Optimizer
                        gtest
                        TestMain)

add_glow_test(<name>Test ${GLOW_BINARY_DIR}/tests/<name>Test --gtest_output=xml:Xtensa<name>Test.xml)`

```
