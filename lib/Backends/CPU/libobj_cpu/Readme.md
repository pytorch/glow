# Archiving additional objects within the bundle object

All the object files (.o) stored in this directory will be automatically
serialized as C buffer arrays and stored within Glow library at build time.
When building bundles with Glow tools the user can opt to archive additional
objects within the bundle object file by specifying the following command line
option:
```
  -bundle-objects=<object1>,<object2>,...
```

For example if this directory contains the files *lib1.o* and *lib2.o* the
user can choose to archive them with the bundle object with the following command:
```
  -bundle-objects=lib1.o,lib2.o
```

The names of the object files stored in this directory must have the *.o* extension
and their names (without extension) must qualify to valid C identifiers.

This is useful for the LLVM based backends in the following scenario:
- A LLVM backend generates a bundle with external calls to functions which are not part
  of LIBJIT. For example this is the case for some kernel libraries which are pre-compiled
  with other compilers than Clang (the one used by default by Glow) for better performance.
- This means that the bundle generated by Glow is not self contained and requires the
  respective library/objects to be provided at link time.
- For a better user experience we can choose not to delegate to the user the responsability
  of linking the additional libraries/objects during link-time but rather make Glow capable
  to archive the additional required objects files to the final bundle such that the bundle
  is self contained and the dependency is hidden from the user. During LLVMIRGen we can specify
  to add an extra object file to the bundle by using the function:
  ```
  void LLVMIRGen::addBundleObject(llvm::StringRef objectName);
  ```
  The above function is provided with the object name which is assumed to be present during Glow
  build time in this directory.
